It's very awkward to write anything. 

After completing this project (this website) I will have a website. At least something that looks a bit like it. 

I'm very slow. At the beginning of the course, I was told to watch videos explaining what the internet is.
I thought I knew what the internet was. I use it everyday. But I didn't. 
I guess it's true that you don't know what you don't know, and I'm not quite sure what my skills will be after completing this project, but I'm excited to find out.
