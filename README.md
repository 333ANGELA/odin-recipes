It's very awkward to write anything. I'm not yet confident but I've learnt how to open a terminal and use the command line. 

I also know what a server is. And the internet too. It sounds silly, but I didn-t know that I didn't know. 

I've only been doing this for a week. It has been enormously rewarding.
